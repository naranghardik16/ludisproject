## Project Scope

Development of a mobile application to facilitate booking of facilities in halls, residential colleges and residences


## Motivation

After having lived in NUS for over a semester, as students we believe that there is a need for a centralized booking system to streamline and improve the booking process. There are a multitude of problems associated with booking these facilities and there is a need for some change. 

As of today, students at Prince Georgeâ€™s Park find it inconvenient to book facilities such as meeting rooms, seminar rooms and multipurpose sports hall, as one has to book at least 3 days in advance over email. Moreover, despite the availability of the facilities, students are often unable  to use these facilities due to the delay in processing the booking requests. Furthermore, time  conflict resolution is also another pressing concern as time conflicts cannot be indicated till the processing of the request. Such problems can be easily solved by an application to book common facilities. 

These problems related to booking of common facilities are also present in many other halls, residential colleges and residences and we believe that we can create an application to solve such  problems similar to REBOKS NUS which is an application to book sports facilities in UTown and University Sports Centre.

## Software Development Plan

We plan to use Confluence and Jira Software to unleash the potential in our development team. We will use the Product Requirements Blueprint to capture our requirements, then create our Jira epic and other issues right from the requirements page in Confluence. By choosing the *Create Jira Issue* link, we will create stories in Jira and then automatically link them to our epic. In this way we will be able to track the progress of the stories from the Confluence page or from within Jira. The tight integration between Confluence and Jira Software facilitates in easy access of issues from the Confluence page also enabling to see their status at a glance. From within Jira software the links to related Confluence pages can also be viewed. 


## Tech Stack

* Flutter 
* Dart 
* Firebase
